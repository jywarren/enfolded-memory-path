# Providence Chinatown, 1914: an enfolded memory path

## _Jeffrey Yoo Warren & Dri Chiu Tattersfield for DIY Methods_

In the [Seeing Lost Enclaves project](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/seeing-lost-enclaves/), we have been carefully researching displaced Chinatown communities through archival research, 3D modeling, zinemaking, and other mediums, with a focus on personal (re)connection, community building, and process reflections, through a process called relational reconstruction. 

![A broadsheet sized color print of many building facades and streetlight-lit cobbled streets, laid out flat in a sprawling collaged map-like arrangement, with text boxes around it.](images/full-spread.jpg)

This zine interweaves a speculative story from the displaced historical Chinatown in Providence, RI with the story of this project and what we have learned from experimenting with care-oriented, multimodal research methods. The story unfolds as a path through the Providence Chinatown neighborhood in 1914 based on Jeffrey’s modeling work. 

We are excited by zines’ potential to serve as a more accessible, non-digital way to share our Chinatown reconstructions with elders and descendants of these communities. Additionally, we have been reflecting deeply on the idea of our model reconstructions as virtual altars, in conversation with family histories of altar-building for ancestors. Paper plays an important role in ancestor offerings, such as burning paper money. How is folding a zine like constructing an altar? We invite you to explore this prompt at the end of our zine. 

With care,

Image: You're in a small dormitory room with a wooden floor and plaster walls. Two windows open onto the cobblestone street a floor below. 

![The first page folds down to reveal a small parquet wood floor, and a plaster wall stands up, a window framing a view down to cobbled street and facing building below.](images/2.jpg)

Text: Look out the window. Dusk illuminates the street below. What do you see?

Prompt: Draw yourself curled up on a chair.

![An angled view through the window frames the grainy doorway of a building across the street.](images/4.jpg)

Image: At the back of the room, a narrow staircase leads down to the first floor. 

![A hand holding the floor up about 2cm by pinching the window frame. A small stair at the front edge now descends to a lower floor.](images/3.jpg)

Text: The murmur of voices draws you downstairs. Your aunt leans over the counter, gossiping with a customer. You run your fingers along the narrow shelves as you walk towards the door. 

![View between two shelves out to the street beyond.](images/7.jpg)

Image: A narrow passage leads between two wooden shelves crowded with shiny porcelain teapots, bowls, vases and, on the top shelf behind glass, boxes with more merchandise. 

Prompt: Which item do you linger on?

Text: Outside, the cool air smells like rain. You take a right at the furniture shop, where polished wood gleams.

Image: As you walk out the door onto the cobblestones, there are several doors open in the small wooden buildings across the street, the facades of which are collaged from old newspapers and photos. Warm light spills onto the street from doors and from windows on the second floors. To your right, down the street, a small theater and tailor shop sit across the intersection with a wider street.

![A new section of street has been folded out to continue beyond the edge of the first "page" of street. More buildings lay flat in the distance.](images/8.jpg)

Text: You make your way down busy Westminster Street, past several shops and a drugstore. You hear: [circle] A dog barking, children playing, wheels splashing through a puddle.

![View after reaching the intersection and turning right.](images/10.jpg)

Image: Turning the corner, you notice more shops on both sides of the street, outside of Chinatown. More tailors, shoe stores, signs for Singer sewing machines, and more. The wide street slopes up towards the distant towers of a cathedral. 

Text: You turn left on Burrill Street, passing the tailor and the back entrance of the Empire Theatre, which you have never entered.

![Looking downward at the cobblestones at the next intersection onto a narrower street to the left.](images/11.jpg)

![View up the narrow street to see several low wooden buildlings ahead as the street curves to the right.](images/12.jpg)

Text: Finally, you reach the destination you had not realized you were wandering towards: the alley between the theater and the grocers, a hiding spot you come to often. 

![View between the wood buildings showing a narrow alley.](images/13.jpg)

Image: At the entrance to a very narrow alley you come across a man in a dark blue linen shirt and pants walking by with a cigarette, the light illuminating his knuckles as he swings his arms. A White man walks a few yards behind him. You pass ahead of them both to step down into the narrow alley between two houses with white clapboard sides.

![Closeup of the blank brick wall at the end of the alley.](images/14.jpg)

![Text boxes around a yellow arrow leading up the wall. (text below)](images/15.jpg)

Image: Passing dark windows, you come up to a very tall blank brick wall, with some wooden shuttered windows high above, and faint outlines of faded painted letters as tall as a child spell out an advertisement for the Empire Theater. The tiny triangular space formed by the oddly intersecting walls is filled with warm light from the back side of the building to your left, which has a grocery storefront almost face-to-face with the brick wall. 

Text: (Left) You lean against the wall and listen to the many lives of your neighborhood unfold. You close your eyes for a moment, and then begin walking home. (Right) Pressing your hands against the wall, you find that it is porous. You climb over to the other side.

![Yellow arrow leading over the wall into a mirror image version of the neighborhood rendered in dimmer blue tones.](images/16.jpg)

Image: As you climb over the brick wall you find yourself in a mirror image of the neighborhood you just traversed, a gloomier, but somehow more contemplative version. Arrows guide you back along the inverse of the path you had walked.

## Reverse side

While a few storefronts opened onto Burrill Street, their signs inviting you in (“Chong Kee Laundry,” “Oriental Restaurant”), much of the neighborhood sat one row back, in the in-between spaces: a print business, a tea shop, a grocery back by the rear of the Empire Theater’s huge brick walls. This neighborhood was a little out of the way, at the edge of downtown, and it felt a little protected – enclosed by larger buildings and streets. I wonder who felt at home here. Was this narrow alley the enclosed and tidy place I imagine, perhaps with small potted plants, swept daily?  – Jeff

I feel my relationship with this place is uncertain, not only as a Korean American living in the neighborhood today, but in ways explored by Jean Wei’s All Purpose God - a bit of the uncertainty of someone seeking reconnection with a now-unfamiliar tradition. Wei tells the story of a diasporic Asian American young person making meanings from the presence of a statue of Tudigong in their household. In my mind, the uncertainty of my relationship with Burrill Street histories is entwined with a desire to show my respect for the place, to honor it. It’s connected with a sense of the place’s need for privacy, contemplation and quiet.  – Jeff

Could this little alley have had a special meaning or purpose? I know via Providence Chinatown historian John Eng-Wong that there was an altar in one of the buildings on Burrill Street, and we can see a photo of one on Empire Street in a Providence Journal article covering Lunar New Year celebrations. But the alley also stands out to me for its possibilities – with no historical reference, but in the way that different altars (especially to different deities and in different traditions) find meaningful spaces above a space or on the floor. Though it seems unlikely we’ll ever know for sure if it held such a purpose, I can imagine wanting to tidy it up, as Pei Pei does for M in Jean Wei’s Dragon Whiskers.  – Jeff

_Relational reconstruction focuses on the potential for a more multifaceted remembrance and correction, through relationships between the experiences partially represented in the archive, and today’s parallel experiences in minoritized groups. It acknowledges the limitations of the archive as a means of accessing erased moments, experiences, and spaces. In this approach, I seek to correct erasure, but through an imaginative, immersive, social, and creative approach, which encloses a gentle and nourishing space rather than enclosing an artifact of history in a diorama at a museum or on a plaque. This process restructures the archive as a set of selective clues, shaped by the active intent to obscure ancestral knowledges best expressed in ways least likely to be historically preserved – emotional tone, color, sound and smell, private moments and ephemera of personal relationships, hopes, aspirations, things unsaid._

The soil remembers. The soil was here before the street was paved and the buildings raised; the soil will be here when the street is widened and the buildings knocked down. The soil will remember, beneath the new street: pollen from vegetable gardens, ceramic fragments, ash. What will remember the sounds, the smells, the memories?  – Dri

Growing up biracial in Taiwan, I did not understand myself as Asian until I was categorized as such upon moving to the United States. What is my connection to Asian American history? Perhaps there isn’t one, in terms of lineage. I’ll create a connection myself, with my hands, folding.  – Dri

Back upstairs, you pause at the table by the window. You remember your mother taking you to 土地公 shrines as a child in China, altars to deities of a specific place. You don’t remember the details, but you decide your neighborhood deserves one too. On a piece of paper, you begin to sketch an altar for this place that is your home, all the things it has been, and all the things it will become: [✎]
